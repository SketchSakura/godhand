      <i>A boy swears vengeance upon a broken sword in the ashes of his home; an Elf steps outside her farm with axe in-hand to water her crops once more with the blood of the hateful; A Col√∫n atop a mountain heaves back the string of a great bow, to loose a true arrow into a dreadful wyrm; a bloodied Raska discards her splintered spear and picks up a rock to face down against a god.</i><br><br>
      These stories and others like them are all of Fighters, those who take up arms or raise their fists to do battle with others using their bodies and their minds. You are not just a body of meat swinging a sword. You are a skilled warrior devoted to the art of battle, honed through discipline, savagery, or desperation into something beyond the ordinary combatant.

  <h2><a class="classlinks" id="fight-varied">Varied Strikes</a></h2>
    <p class="info">
      Being either a traditionally trained, or intrinsically more tactically inclined combatant, you‚Äôve found a variety of ways to use your weapons and skill that applies far beyond merely harming others. At 1st level, you gain these options to use in combat:
    </p>
    <details class="sub-list"><summary><b>Options:</b></summary>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Parry:</b> As a reaction when you are targeted by a weapon attack, you can choose to add your proficiency bonus to your Armor Class against an attack that would otherwise hit. You must be wielding a shield or a melee weapon to use this reaction.</li><br>
        <li><b>Cleave:</b> As an action, you may make a single melee weapon attack against a creature. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your weapon reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.</li><br>
        <li><b>Kick:</b> As an action, you may unbalance a target within your melee reach. Make an attack roll. If it hits, you reduce the target‚Äôs Armor Class by a number equal to half the total of your maximum unarmed damage die (minimum 1) until the beginning of your next turn. For example, if your unarmed damage die is 1d4, then the target‚Äôs AC would be reduced by 2. If your target has more than two legs, your attack roll has disadvantage.</li><br>
        <li><b>Pinpoint Shot:</b> As an action, you may make an attack with a ranged weapon or a melee weapon with the Thrown property. If the attack hits, it deals an additional damage die and the target must succeed on a Strength save with a DC equal to 8+your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier or be knocked prone.</li><br>
      </ul>
    </details>
  <h2><a class="classlinks" id="fight-style">Fighting Style</a></h2>
    <p class="info">
      You have a particular method of utilizing weapons and facing opponents. At first level, you gain a Fighting Style of your choice that affords you certain benefits in combat.
      <br>
      <details class="sub-list"><summary><b>Archery Style</b></summary>
        <ul>
          <li>You may add your Strength modifier to damage rolls when using bows, in addition to your Dexterity modifier.</li>

          <li>You no longer have disadvantage on ranged attack rolls made on targets within 5 feet of you.</li>
          <br>
          <li>When you use your Pinpoint Shot, the additional damage die is maximized</li>

      <details class="sub-list"><summary><b>Ascetic Style</b></summary>
        <ul>
          <li>While not wearing armor, you gain a bonus to AC equal 10 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity bonus (your choice). You lose this bonus if you equip armor or a shield.</li>
          <br>
          <li>The damage die for your unarmed strikes increases a step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8)</li>

          <br>
          <li>You can use your bonus action to make a grapple, shove, or trip attempt. You can also use this bonus action to automatically deal damage to any creature grappled by you. The damage dealt this way is equal to your strength modifier.</li>

      <details class="sub-list"><summary><b>Dual Wielder's Style</b></summary>
        <ul>

          <br>
          <li>When you use your bonus action to engage in <a href="combat.html#twf"><u>Two-Weapon Fighting</u></a>, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus.

  <h2><a class="classlinks" id="fight-strategies">Fighter Strategy</a></h2>
    <p class="info">
      At 2nd level,  you learn one Fighter strategy. This defines more sharply how you approach combat. To use a strategy, you enter a stance associated with it as a bonus action. You remain in that stance until you choose to exit it, or you enter another strategy‚Äôs stance as a bonus action. Choose from the list below. You gain an additional strategy at 7th, 13th, and 17th level.
    </p>
      <details class="sub-list"><summary><b>Options:</b></summary>
          <br>
        <b>Aggressive:</b> You approach combat more harshly and recklessly than your peers. While in this stance, when you attack, you may declare you are attacking aggressively. When you do so, roll two damage totals, and take the higher result. Any creature you attack aggressively has advantage on attack rolls made to hit you on its turn.
          <br><br>
        <b>Bulwark:</b> When you adopt this stance,you may extend the effect of your Parry to your allies within your weapon reach, but you cannot use your Parry to protect against attacks targeting you.
          <br><br>
        <b>Choke-up:</b> You take a tighter grip on your melee weapon to ensure accurate attacks, at the cost of those attacks being less effective. You gain advantage on all melee attacks you make. When you land a hit while using this strategy, roll two damage totals and take the lower result.
          <br><br>
        <b>Close-Quarters Shooter:</b> When you adopt this stance, you can no longer make ranged weapon attacks outside your weapon‚Äôs close range increment. When you roll damage on a ranged weapon attack, including your Pinpoint Shot, roll twice and take the higher total.
          <br><br>
        <b>Commander:</b> You may take the help action as a bonus action. You may also forgo one attack per turn to order an ally whom you can see and which can hear you to use their reaction to make an attack of their own. While using this strategy, you cannot use your Varied Strikes.
          <br><br>
        <b>Defensive Focus:</b> You enter a guarded stance. While in this stance, your attacks deal half damage, but your Parry no longer uses your reaction.
          <br><br>
        <b>Flurry:</b>  You may choose to forgo your proficiency bonus on all attacks you make in a single turn. When you do so, you gain an extra attack. This increases to two extra attacks at 11th level.
          <br><br>
        <b>Magebane:</b> When you adopt this stance, and someone casts a spell within 30 feet of you, they provoke an attack of opportunity. If the attack hits, they must make a concentration check or lose the spell. Your Parry also works against spell attacks, however your Parry cannot be used against physical attacks while in this stance.
          <br><br>
        <b>Sniper:</b> You make attack rolls at your weapon‚Äôs mid range without penalty and at its long range without disadvantage and with a -2 penalty. You also ignore half-cover, and have advantage on perception checks. While using this strategy, your movement speed is reduced to 10 feet.

      Hierophants are as disparate as the concepts they embody, and the gods they serve. These people are exceedingly rare, and are hailed as prophets, omens, and signs of great or terrible things to come. Despite this, they are still very much people and the weight of their existence can weigh heavier on them than it would most, depending on how they view their place in the world.

      You work magic through your faith and a direct connection to the divine. You cast spells from the Hierophant spell list.
    <br><br><b>Cantrips</b>
    <br>You know three cantrips of your choice from the Hierophant spell list. Cantrips can be cast at will, indefinitely, without expending a spell slot. You learn additional cantrips at higher levels as shown in the cantrips column of the Hierophant table.
    <br><br><b>Spell Slots</b><br>
      On the Hierophant table you can find how many spell slots you have for leveled (1st circle or higher) Hierophant spells. To cast a leveled spell, you must expend a slot of the spell‚Äôs level or higher.
    <br>
      You prepare a number of spells per day equal to your Hierophant level + your Wisdom modifier. At the end of a long rest, you choose which spells to have prepared of all those available on the Hierophant list.
    <br><br><b>Casting Ability</b>
      As a Hierophant, your spellcasting ability is Wisdom, as you draw divine power into the world through your faith. You use your Wisdom modifier to calculate your bonus to hit with a spell, and the DC of saves against your spells (or class/subclass features, if relevant).

      <br>
      <details class="sub-list"><summary><b>Aspect of the Weatherer</b></summary>
        <p class="info">You are a fighter, through and through. Perhaps you were a warrior before becoming a Hierophant, or perhaps the way of battle is simply a part of your faith. Whatever the case, you make use of your connection to the divine to protect others from the cold death that awaits them at the end of the sword, or to bring down the fury of gods upon your enemies. You gain the following features from your aspect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>At 2nd level</b>, you gain proficiency in a martial weapon of your choice. You also gain either proficiency with light and medium armor or with the Ascetic fighting style (see under <a href="#fight-style"><u>Fighter</u></a>).</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>At 5th level</b>, you gain moments of inspiration while in combat.  When you use your action to attack with a weapon or an unarmed strike, you may use your bonus action to make a second attack with the same weapon (or unarmed strike). You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, regaining all uses on a short or long rest.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>At 9th level</b>, you learn to properly blend your skill with a weapon and your divine power. When you use your action to attack with a weapon (or make an unarmed strike), you may use your bonus action to cast a cantrip. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your wisdom modifier, regaining all uses on a short or long rest.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>At 13th level</b>, when you hit a target with a weapon attack, or an unarmed strike, you deal an additional d8 of damage. You choose the damage type when you gain this ability at 13th level.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>At 18th level</b>, you are encircled by spectral manifestations of your weapon of choice. These spiritual weapons guard you, and deliver strikes in tandem with your own. When a creature rolls an attack against you, you may instantly roll one against them (using Wisdom in place of Strength or Dexterity) before their attack hits. If you hit, the target must roll their attack a second time and choose the lower value of the two. You then deal 1d8 of radiant or necrotic damage + your Wisdom modifier. You may do this a number of times per round equal to your Wisdom modifier.<br><br>
          Additionally, your bonus action attack and casts no longer have a limit upon their uses.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      <br><details class="sub-list"><summary><b>Aspect of the Teacher</b></summary>
        <p class="info">You are a guide, a guardian, a person of the people. You make use of your divine power to influence others, to impart upon them teachings of the world, and guidance through difficult times. You are the anchor for others, and one that many turn to for wisdom in difficult times. You gain the following features from your aspect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>At 2nd level</b>, choose Intimidation or Persuasion. You gain expertise in the chosen skill.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>At 5th level</b>, you may spend ten minutes in communion with your allies, reciting passages and telling stories meant to calm and inspire them. When you do this, all creatures within 30 feet of you who can understand what you say gain temporary HP equal to your level, plus your Wisdom modifier.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>At 9th level</b>,you can call for peace before violence breaks out. When you roll initiative, you may use your reaction to try and call out to a number of opposing creatures equal to your proficiency bonus. Those creatures must make a Wisdom saving throw versus your spell save DC. On a failed save, each of these creatures is charmed by you for a minute. If you successfully charm over half of your targets (or if they have a leader you manage to charm) any other opposing creatures will refrain from attacking you for the duration with their allies. While charmed in this way, you must attempt to talk your opponents down. If you or your allies attack, or attempt to flee, the creatures cease to be charmed and initiative resumes. If you fail to talk your opponents down, initiative resumes.<br><br>This ability automatically fails on creatures who cannot understand you.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>At 13th level</b>, allies within 30 feet who can see or hear you add their proficiency bonus to Wisdom saving throws.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>At 18th level</b>, your teachings are both inspirational and ironclad. If you spend an hour in constant, uninterrupted conversation with a creature, you may make a persuasion or Intimidation check contested by an Insight check from the creature. If the total of your check is higher, the creature is charmed by you for 30 days. During this time, the creature obeys any commands you give it, and acts in accordance with all teachings you impart (or have imparted) on it. At the end of this duration, the creature will continue to act in accordance with your teachings, but its willingness to obey your commands depends on the way you treated it during the previous 30 days.<br><br>Once a creature has been under the effects of this ability, it is immune to further attempts to use this feature on them by others unless something causes that creature to forsake you and your ideals. Your fellow player characters are immune to this ability.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      <br><details class="sub-list"><summary><b>Aspect of the Conduit</b></summary>
        <p class="info">You are, first and foremost, a true vessel for divine power. You are a mage, and you shape reality in accordance with your will. When you speak, the earth and the heavens alike listen, and shape themselves in accordance with your words. You appear divine to others, seeming to lack any mortal quality, possessing something far more complex in its place. You gain the following features from your aspect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>At 2nd level</b>, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage or healing done by any spell or cantrip you cast with an instantaneous duration.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>At 5th level</b>, you may use your bonus action to momentarily take on a more divine, more horrifying, or more incomprehensible shape (albeit one still recognizably Sublunarian). Any creatures within 30 feet that can see you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened for the duration. Any frightened creature may attempt this save again at the start of their turn, ending the effect on a success. A creature affected in this way is immune for the next 24 hours. You may use this feature once, regaining uses upon a short or long rest.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>At 9th level</b>, after casting a leveled spell, you may use your bonus action to cast a cantrip.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>At 13th level</b>, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed. How you gain the ability to fly is up to you. It could be anything from angelic wings, to simple levitation.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>At 18th level</b>, you gain power beyond measure. You learn the shape reality spell.</li>

  <h2><a class="classlinks" id="hiero-give-of-yourself">Give of Yourself</a></h2>
    <p class="info">
      Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to sacrifice your own energy in the form of divine power, for the sake of your allies. You may spend a number of your hit dice equal to your proficiency bonus to perform one of the following:
    </p>
    <p class="info">
    <b>Invoke Wrath</b>
    <br>As a reaction when an ally rolls damage for an attack they made, they roll the hit die you expended and add your Wisdom modifier and the total rolled to any damage they would already deal. You choose the damage type added by your hit die when you gain this ability at 3rd level.
      <br><br>
    <b>Divine Vitae</b>
    <br>As a reaction when an ally takes damage, roll the hit die you would expend. Your ally instantly heals a number of HP equal to the total of your roll. If you use this ability on an effect that would kill an ally outright, either due to massive damage, or the nature of the effect (such as a disintegrate spell), your ally does not heal, but instead drops to 0 HP and begins making death saving throws.
    </p>
  <h2><a class="classlinks" id="hiero-anointed">Anointed</a></h2>
    <p class="info">
      At 6th level, a halo forms around your head, marking you as a chosen saint of your faith. The halo appears how you choose, it could be a circle of perfect light, a crown of white hot flame, or anything of a similar nature.
      <br><br>You may use an action to hide or to manifest the halo. While the halo surrounds your head, it sheds bright light in a 10 foot radius and dim light for 20 feet beyond that. While you manifest the halo, commoners and people of similar faith treat you with a very deliberate reverence and respect, while those with faiths and ideals that oppose yours might learn of your presence, and plot your downfall.
      <br><br>You may grant yourself advantage on Intimidation, Persuasion, or Insight checks against any creature that can see the halo up to a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all uses of this feature on a long rest. In addition, you may force a creature within 30 feet of you that you‚Äôve been speaking to for at least a minute to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. If the creature fails, you learn their surface thoughts as per the Detect Thoughts spell. The creature is not aware of your attempt to learn their thoughts regardless of whether they succeed or fail the saving throw.
    </p>
  <h2><a class="classlinks" id="hiero-asifeat">Ability Score Improvement & Feat</a></h2>
    <p class="info">
      When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you may increase one ability score by 2, or two ability scores by 1.<br><br>Alternatively, whenever you would get an ability score improvement, you may instead take a feat.
    </p>
  <h2><a class="classlinks" id="hiero-face-div">Face Divinity</a></h2>
    <p class="info">
      At 10th level, you gain the ability to invoke true divine power, calling for the aid of your god, or attempting to tap into the raw essence of your domain. Describe what it is you seek, and roll percentile dice. If the total roll is below your Hierophant level, a miracle occurs. The GM determines the nature of this miracle, depending on what you‚Äôve sought out, and how that might be interpreted. If a miracle occurs as a result of this feature, you can‚Äôt use it again for seven days. If nothing happens, you regain the ability to use it after a long rest.<br><br>At 20th level, you invoke miracles automatically, without requiring a roll.

        <i>A Cambion girl with eyes like a dog spills the blood of her lover over a ritual circle, crying out for the power to destroy her enemies; An imposing Human dressed in a deep blue cloak opens his eyes to see the thoughts of his enemy revealed before him; A Catfolk merchant snaps his fingers and disappears, just as a pair of debt collectors round the corner.</i><br><br>
        Each of these characters are Wizards, strange individuals who devote themselves to obsessive study in the pursuit of power. Their goals are often more personal or esoteric than they are megalomaniacal, but at the heart of everything is the yearning for the ability to change the world in some deep, fundamental way. What could such a thing be called, besides power?

    <h2><a class="classlinks" id="wiz-spell">Spellcasting</a></h2>
    <p class="info">
      As a wizard, you approach magic like a science. Your ability to cast is informed by your knowledge of the mysteries arcane, and how you might invoke them for power. You carry a spellbook filled with arcane formulae, which is the sum of all your knowledge, and the recipe book for all the magic you can cast.
    <br><br><b>Cantrips</b>
    <br>You know three cantrips of your choice from the Wizard spell list. Cantrips can be cast at will, indefinitely, without spending spell slots. You learn additional cantrips at higher levels as shown in the cantrips column of the Wizard table.
    <br><br><b>Spell Slots</b><br>
      On the Wizard table you can find how many spell slots you have for leveled (1st level or higher) Wizard spells. To cast a leveled spell, you must expend a slot of the spell‚Äôs level or higher.
    <br>
      You prepare a number of spells per day equal to your Wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. At the end of a long rest, you choose which spells to have prepared of the ones stored in your arcane record. Any spell you don‚Äôt have prepared, you won‚Äôt be able to cast.
    <br><br><b>Casting Ability</b>
    As a Wizard, your spellcasting ability is Intelligence, as you gain the ability to invoke power through rigorous study and intense effort. You use your Intelligence modifier to calculate your bonus to hit with a spell, and the DC of saves against your spells (or class/subclass features, if relevant).
    <br><br><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Spell Save DC</b> = 8 + your proficency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
    <br><b>Spell Attack Modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier</p>
    <p style="font-size:21px; text-align:center;"><a href="spells/wizard.html"><u>Wizard Spell List</u></a></p>
    </p>
    <h2><a class="classlinks" id="wiz-arcane-record">Arcane Record</a></h2>
    <p class="info">
      As a 1st level Wizard, your arcane record contains six 1st level Wizard spells of your choice, and gains an additional 2 for every subsequent Wizard level. The two spells gained must be of a level you can cast. All spells you know are stored in this record, save for cantrips which remain fixed in your mind. The spells you add beyond that reflect research you conduct and breakthroughs you have in regards to the true shape of reality; you may also copy spells into your record you find on scrolls, or recorded by other wizards you meet on your adventures.
      <br><br>
      <b>Copying Spells</b>
      <br>You can only copy spells you have the ability to cast (a 5th level Wizard, for example, can‚Äôt copy a 9th circle spell). To copy any spell into your record takes both 2 hours and 50 gold of materials, times the circle of the spell being copied (for example, a 1st circle spell will take 2 hours and 50 gold, a 2nd circle spell will take 4 hours and 100 gold, etc).
      <br><br>
      Your arcane record may take one of the following forms:
      <br>
      <details class="sub-list"><b><summary>Record Options:</b></summary>
      <dl>
        <dt><b>Tome: </b>The classic spellbook. Your arcane record is a thick volume of complex, painstakingly outlined magic. With this record being so distinctly organized, you know where everything is, and how to access it. As an Action, you may search your spellbook to find a spell you haven‚Äôt prepared. When you‚Äôve found the spell, you may treat the spell as being ‚Äúprepared‚Äù until the end of your next turn.</dt>
        <br>
          <dd><b>Replacing the Tome: </b>The cost of an empty spellbook is around 100GP. It would be wise for a mage who keeps their record in this way to have a second stored away in a safe place in the case of their tome being damaged or destroyed. The tome, and the gold cost of copying a spell is halved when a Wizard copies a spell from their spellbook into another spellbook, due to their familiarity with the subject matter and writing style.</dd>
          <br>
        <dt><b>Inscribed: </b>You have made your magic a distinct part of you by recording it in tattoos, scars, or brands in your skin, and in doing so, you have imparted onto yourself some level of arcane presence. You may use your body as a spellcasting focus for spells that require a material component.</dt>
        <br>
          <dd><b>Replacing Inscriptions: </b>Unlike other options, there is no cost to replacing spells ‚Äúlost‚Äù that had been inscribed on your skin due to things like scarring or dismemberment. The inscription process and its magical nature keep the magic at least somewhat grounded in the very background of your mind. If you are scarred or injured and lose some of your work, it is assumed that either through your own efforts to restore it, or the shifting of patterns on your skin, the integrity of the information is retained. Your arcane record can only be destroyed if your body is too.</dd>
          <br>
        <dt><b>Loose Leaf: </b>Your magic is kept together as a collection of loose notes and papers. This unorganized method of recordkeeping forces you to become more intimate and familiar with the knowledge you record than a wizard who might keep their knowledge organized in a book. You may attempt to draw an unprepared spell from the dregs of your memory to cast in the moment you need it most. When attempting to cast a spell you don‚Äôt have prepared, roll an Intelligence check. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + the spell‚Äôs level. If you pass the check, you cast the spell as normal. If you fail, you lose the spell slot associated with the spell you were attempting to cast.</dt>
        <br>
          <dd><b>Replacing your Notes: </b> Like a tome, it would be prudent for a wizard keeping their arcane record in loose notes to have a backup set. It is in fact more important, because notes are lost and damaged much more easily than a full book. Thankfully, the cost of buying more paper on which to scrawl more notes is negligible. The cost of actually scribing these notes however, is not. The time needed and the gold cost for replicating a spell in a new set of notes is the same as it would be to copy that spell for the first time into your record.</dd>

      Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to create scrolls of spells you have stored in your arcane record. The gold cost and time necessary to craft a scroll is double that of the gold cost and time it takes you to record a spell of the same level (and school, if relevant) into your arcane record, as outlining the intricacies of casting in terms a layman can understand often requires a few tries to accurately describe.

    <h2><a class="classlinks" id="wiz-mysteries-arcane">Mysteries Arcane</a></h2>
    <p class="info">
      At 5th level, 10th level, and 15th level, your arcane record brings a greater, unique strength to your magic by tapping into the greater mysteries of reality. You gain your choice of one of the following benefits based on your arcane record‚Äôs form:
      <br><details class="sub-list"><summary><b>Tome:</b></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Nomicon: </b>Your spellbook doubles as a repository of information on a specific type of creature. Choose a creature type that isn‚Äôt Sublunarian. You can instantly recognize creatures of that creature type, and may take an Action to search the book and find their relevant entry. The entry tells you the creature‚Äôs HP, AC, resistances, vulnerabilities, and any relevant or unique weaknesses they might have</li>
          <li><b>Published: </b>Your volume has been given to a publisher and is now sold as a product. Every day, you gain a number of gold equal to half your level in royalties. You must be in a properly equipped settlement (like a city) to collect on these royalties.</li>
          <li><b>Cipher: </b>Your spellbook is written as something other than a spellbook. It may appear as a cookbook, a fictional novel, a collection of poetry, or something else entirely. Anyone who reads it without the knowledge the book is a spellbook cannot glean its true nature, and anyone who reads it with the knowledge of it being a spellbook must make an Intelligence check against your spell save DC to understand its meaning every time they attempt to read it. In addition, your magic too becomes more difficult to read and predict. Casters have disadvantage on checks made to counterspell you.</li>
          <li><b>Open Book: </b>If you hold the book in your off-hand, you may use a Bonus Action to read from it as you cast. Every time you use your Bonus Action in this way, you can choose to add your Intelligence modifier to damage dealt by your spells.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      <br><details class="sub-list"><summary><b>Inscribed:</b></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Warded: </b>You learn the Mage Armor spell, if you don‚Äôt know it already. You always have this spell prepared, and gain the ability to cast it at will.</li>
          <li><b>Blood Mage: </b>You may call upon your vitality to draw upon magic even when your reserves are dry. You may cast a spell without using a spell slot. When you cast in this way, roll a number of hit dice equal to the spell‚Äôs level +1. Those hit dice are expended, and your hit point maximum is reduced by a number equal to the total. This reduction lasts until you complete a long rest.</li>
          <li><b>Rough: </b>You‚Äôve shaped yourself into someone more resilient than the average mage. Your hit point maximum increases by 1 for every Wizard level you possess and increases by 1 again with every Wizard level you gain.</li>
          <li><b>Body as a Canvas: </b> You can inscribe a spell you know on the flesh of a willing ally over the course of a long rest. When the process is complete, the ally can cast the spell you‚Äôve inscribed as an Action once, regaining the ability to do so on a long rest. A character may only have one spell inscribed on them in this way at a time.</li>
          <li><b>A Living Work of Art: </b>When choosing this feature, choose either Intimidation or Performance. You gain the ability to use Intelligence in place of Charisma on checks with the selected skill, and advantage on checks with the associated skill when your inscriptions are visible to others.</li>
          <li><b>Hyperfocus: </b>Your body becomes a more powerful focus for your spells. You are a +1 focus at Wizard level 5, a +2 focus at Wizard level 10, and a +3 focus at Wizard level 15.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      <br><details class="sub-list"><summary><b>Loose Leaf:</b></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Fool‚Äôs Resolution: </b>Even when the formulae don‚Äôt come to you, you can force the magic you‚Äôve taken hold of to still become something. You can use this feature to roll on the Wild Magic table after failing your check to cast an unprepared spell.</li>
          <li><b>Off the Cuff: </b>You may cast a spell with the casting time of one Action once as a Bonus Action, expending a slot one level higher than the spell‚Äôs level (for example to cast ‚ÄúMage Armor‚Äù as a Bonus Action, you would use a 2nd Circle slot). You regain the ability to use this feature when you complete a long rest.</li>
          <li><b>Quick Fingered: </b>After using your free Object Interaction, you may make an additional object interaction as a Bonus Action as opposed to an Action.</li>
          <li><b>Improvise: </b>Once per short or long rest, you may replace an ability check you make with an Arcana check, as you improvise a simple magical solution on the fly to pull through the situation as opposed to using the relevant skill.</li>
          <li><b>Paper Trail: </b>You gain the ability to throw a fistful of your papers in an opponent‚Äôs face, allowing you to disengage as a Bonus action thanks to the distraction. When you use this ability, roll a d20. On a natural 1, you lose the components to cast a spell recorded in your notes (you choose which of your spells known you lose when you do this). Each additional time you do this, the margin for losing a spell doubles (from a 1 on the d20, to a 2, to a 4, and so on). This margin resets after you take a long rest, or after you lose a spell from doing this</li>
        </ul>
      </details>
    </p>
    <h2><a class="classlinks" id="wiz-internalize">Internalize</a></h2>
    <p class="info">
      At 7th level when you see a spell being cast, you can use your Reaction to instantly memorize the motions the mage makes, the intonation with which they evoke the power, and any components they use to cast the spell. From this information, you can work backwards in your mind to decipher some element of how this spell works, and attempt to cast it yourself.
      <br><br>
      To cast a spell in this way, you must have a spell slot equal to the spell‚Äôs base level, and immediately expend it to make an Arcana check with a DC equal to 10 + twice the spell‚Äôs level. If the spell you‚Äôre attempting to cast isn‚Äôt on the Wizard spell list, you make this check with disadvantage. If you succeed the check, the spell takes effect. Regardless of whether you succeed or fail, the spell slot is lost. You have disadvantage on checks to keep concentration on spells cast in this way.
      <br><br>
      You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before taking a long rest.
    </p>
    <h2><a class="classlinks" id="wiz-sub-focus">Subconscious Focus</a></h2>
    <p class="info">
      At 18th level, when you cast a spell that requires concentration, you may declare that you are focusing on the spell subconsciously. When you do so, the spell does not require your concentration to remain active. Taking damage does not threaten to end your concentration on a subconsciously focused spell, and you may concentrate on other spells or features while having a spell active in this way. You may only focus subconsciously on one spell at a time. You cannot subconsciously focus on an internalized spell.
      <br>
      You must complete a short or long rest before using this feature again.
