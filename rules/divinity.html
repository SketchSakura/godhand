            <b>EDITOR‚ÄôS NOTE:</b> It is worth noting that this is the most recently developed content in this document. It has not been officially tested, and the quality of the writing runs the risk of being lower than other elements present here. That being said, this is intended to be a core part of our game. So much so that there is an entire chapter dedicated to it. It is almost certain to change with future game development, but for the time being, we wanted for the idea to be present, at the very least, for the sake of making it clear that we plan to take GODHAND in exciting directions beyond the familiar territories of tabletop fantasy.<br><br>

          In addition to levels in their chosen class, GODHAND characters make progress in a second way, gaining what are known as Divine levels. Unlike class levels, which represent growth in areas of skill, strength, fortitude, experience, and in some cases raw power, Divine levels represent one‚Äôs sheer greatness, through acts and deeds. Divine levels are not trained, they are not dependent on any one specific skill or ability, they arise as the simple result of one‚Äôs actions, and mindset. As a character becomes stronger and becomes responsible for more and more great feats, they become closer and closer to ‚Äòdivinity,‚Äô or something akin to it.

    <p class="info">
      A character can gain, at maximum, 10 Divine levels (as opposed to 20 Class levels), and these levels are gained alongside Class levels, though unlike Class levels, a character begins play with 0 Divine levels. There are three potential ways Divine levels can be gained:
    </p>
    <h3>Levels</h3>
      <p class="info2">
        For a GM who wants to thoroughly integrate Divine levels into their game, or who intends to lean more into the power fantasy Divine levels provide, while keeping them uniform across all players in their game, this is the most straightforward and balanced method of implementing them. For every <b>2</b> character levels player characters gain, they gain one Divine level. Meaning that at level <b>2</b>, their Divine level is <b>1</b>, at level <b>4</b>, their Divine level is <b>2</b>, at level <b>6</b> it is <b>3</b>, and so on.
      </p>
    <h3>Trials</h3>
      <p class="info2">
        For a GM who wants something more thematic in their implementation of Divine levels, they can devise specific trials for their players. Conflicts, great deeds, triumphs, even particularly spectacular failures can net players their Divine levels. Ultimately, the GM decides when players gain these levels, and builds arcs of the story around player characters reaching greater and greater heights.
      </p>
    <h3>GODHAND Moments</h3>
      <p class="info2">
        The most effort intensive method of gaining Divine levels, but also potentially the most satisfying, at character creation a GM might ask their players to write out a specific thing each of them want their character to accomplish. Ideally, these should be realistically achievable, easy to define goals. ‚ÄúSlay one hundred men,‚Äù is a better GODHAND moment than ‚Äúsurvive an impossible battle.‚Äù
      </p>
    <hr>
    <p class="info">
      Additionally, these should be something players should be able to seek out and accomplish on their own, without a great deal of handholding by the GM. They should be tasks a player can approach proactively. ‚ÄúAssassinate the king and pose as his heir for the throne,‚Äù is a better GODHAND moment than ‚ÄúWait until the crown is passed on to me.‚Äù Should a GM be confident enough in their ability to deliver on their player‚Äôs wishes though, none of these moments are necessarily impossible to manage, but ideally there is an established baseline.<br><br>
      When a player character accomplishes their GODHAND moment, they instantly gain a Divine level, and must craft a new GODHAND moment, for their character to pursue after the fact.<br><br>
      Because this method runs the risk of some player characters progressing much faster than others, when using GODHAND moments, if any player character is more than 2 Divine levels above the rest, each player character aside from them gains a Divine level, as each member of the game‚Äôs cast is bound together by fate.<br><br>
      A GM can only use ONE of these modes of progression at once, for the sake of keeping players from gaining Divine levels at a steady pace, because none of the three function particularly well when a second method of gaining Divine levels is introduced into play.

  <h2><a class="ruleslink" id="motes">Motes</a></h2>
    <p class="info">
      At their first Divine level, a player character gains small motes of divinity within their soul, these little slivers of divine power within them allow them to perform great feats beyond something any sublunary creature should be capable of. A character has a number of divine motes equal to their proficiency bonus, plus their Divine level. All expended motes of divinity are recovered on a long rest.
    </p>
  <h2><a class="ruleslink" id="divine-will">Divine Will</a></h2>
    <p class="info">
      At Divine level 1, a player character can spend a mote of divinity to add an dice to any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check they make. This die is a d6, but it increases to a d8 at Divine level 4, a d10 at Divine level 7, and a d12 at Divine level 12.
    </p>
  <h2><a class="ruleslink" id="fated">Fated</a></h2>
    <p class="info">
      At Divine level 2, a character‚Äôs fate becomes etched in the cosmos, and their divine nature grants them some measure of power over death. When a character with this ability would die, either instantly by the effect of a spell or massive damage, or slowly after failing their death saving throws, they may spend a mote of divinity to instantly recover with 1 hit point in a burst of their own power, healing all allied creatures within 30 feet for 1 roll of their divine will die, and damaging all enemy creatures within 30 feet for the same value that their allies are healed.<br><br>
      Upon using this ability, a character is instantly brought to exhaustion level 3 (unless their exhaustion level is 3 or higher, in which case they simply stabilize at 0 hit points without regaining consciousness).<br><br>
      A character cannot use this ability again until a week‚Äôs time passes after using it.
    </p>
  <h2><a class="ruleslink" id="asi">Ability Score Improvements</a></h2>
    <p class="info">
      At Divine level 3, 6, and 9, a character gains 2 points to assign to any one skill of their choice, or to be split up among 2 skills.

    <p class="info">
      At Divine level 6, a character may choose a greater, more powerful form to inhabit that is representative of their nature as a demigod. As an action, a player character may expend a number of motes equal to their proficiency bonus to transform into a monster with a challenge factor less than or equal to their character level for a number of rounds equal to half their proficiency bonus (rounded up). A character in this form gains all the monster‚Äôs physical ability scores, hit points, and special abilities. However, they retain their class abilities, and mental ability scores. If a character is reduced to 0 hit points in this form, they are reverted to their true form, and knocked unconscious.<br><br>
      At Divine level 8, a character can maintain this form for a minute.<br><br>
      At Divine level 10, the maximum challenge factor for this form is equal to a character's level, plus their Divine level, and they may maintain this form indefinitely.<br><br>
      A character chooses which monster they will use as their divine form when they gain this ability, and may only transform into that, and no other creatures. When a character gains a Divine level, they may change what monster they transform into as their divine form.

      As a character gains Divine levels, they also gain a divine path, which dictates what sort of demigod they are. The current paths available are: The Marauder, a warlike path for an individual pursuing strength and glory through combat, The Fool, a path for the cunning trickster who always finds an edge over their opponents, and The Hand, a supernatural force of nature. Many more paths will be added, and the current paths will have their abilities expanded upon in the future, but for the time being, these three are simply present for testing in the beta.<br><br>
      Each path grants a character access to different abilities, however there is a number of universal path abilities open to receive as well, in place of any from a character‚Äôs official path. A character gains divine path abilities at Divine levels 3, 6, and 9. Some path abilities have certain prerequisites the character must meet before they can choose them.
