          GODHAND is played by a group of players led by an individual called the <b>Game Master (GM) - the ‚ÄúGod Hand.‚Äù</b> The <b>GM</b> is responsible for overseeing the game and all that happens in it. They tell the brunt of the story, serve as a sort of referee for the table and the rules. Without the <b>GM</b> the game is impossible, as a player might describe themselves creating a powerful explosion with magic, but without the <b>GM</b> there will be no reason for the explosion to be cast. There will be no evildoers to catch in the explosion, no idyllic pasture to set aflame with the fire created by the magic, no story to be told after the party burns down a sacred forest and needs to go on the run from a variety of very angry fae creatures.<br><br>
          The players, in turn, make a single character to explore the setting laid out by the GM. They breathe life into that character, and act in the game based on how their character would behave in any given situation.

    <h2><a class="ruleslink" id="dice">Dice</a></h2>
      <p class="info">
        GODHAND uses several different sets of dice, requiring dice with different numbers of sides for different rolls. One can find dice like those mentioned in this text in game stores and bookstores, but there are also plenty of systems over the internet that will perform dice rolls in a similar manner.<br><br>
        In these rules, dice are referred to by their number of sides. A D4 has 4 sides (and it‚Äôs a little pyramid!), a D6 has six sides (classic dice), a D20 has 20 sides, and so on and so forth. D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, and D20 are the dice used by this system. There will sometimes be mention of ‚Äúpercentile dice‚Äù or something called a ‚ÄúD100.‚Äù These two terms mean the same thing. A D100 is rolled by rolling two 10 sided dice, where one (decided before the roll) gives the 10s digit, and the other gives the 1s digit. A roll of a 5 for the 10s place, and a 7 for the 1s place, would be a 57. Two zeroes represent 100.<br><br>
        The D20 is used for most rolls both player and GM make in GODHAND, as when the outcome of an action is uncertain (such as trying to avoid the brunt of the damage in an explosion, or trying to woo a beautiful stranger) a player or the GM will roll a D20 to determine the outcome of the event.<br><br>
        Every character - both those played and those controlled by the GM - have capabilities determined by six ability scores. Those scores are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. These scores typically range from 5 to 18 for most heroes, though legendary foes and monsters might have scores around 30, and pitiful creatures might have a score of 1 in a given ability. These scores, and the ability modifiers they provide the players, are the basis on which every roll in GODHAND stands. To provide a brief overview, the three main kinds of D20 roll are as follows:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Attack:</b> An attack roll is a d20 roll to directly hit a target with a weapon or spell.</li><br>
          <li><b>Saves:</b> : A save is a roll made to avoid a harmful effect, such as explosions, rockslides, magical lightning bolts, mind control, exhaustion, or anything else that might kill you or harm you in some manner other than attacks.</li><br>
          <li><b>Checks:</b> Checks are most often made out of combat with an ability score, or a skill relevant to something a character is attempting to do. More often than not, a check will be made with a skill as opposed to a pure ability. Trying to flirt with a barmaid, for example, may require a performance check, while armwrestling a monster would require an athletics check.</li><br>
        </ul>
      <p style="text-align:center;">
        A typical D20 dice roll tends to go as such:  
        <dl style="text-align:center;">
          <dt><b>1. </b>Dice are rolled, and modifiers are added:</dt>
            <dd>A player rolls a D20 and adds their relevant modifier. This usually includes the bonus provided by the ability relevant to the roll (such as Strength for an attack or Wisdom to spot something).</dd><br>
          <dt><b>2. </b>Circumstantial bonuses and drawbacks are added:</dt>
            <dd>Class features, spells, character level, feats, and the particular circumstances surrounding a roll might affect any bonuses or drawbacks applied to it.</dd><br>
            <dt><b>3. </b>Compare the total to the target number:</dt>
            <dd>If the total of the roll (after benefits and drawbacks applied) meets or is higher than the target number, the roll is considered a success. If the roll is lower than the target number, it‚Äôs considered a failure. The GM is usually the one to determine the target number for these rolls.<br><br>
            The target number for a save or a check is called the <b>Difficulty Class (DC)</b>, the target number for an attack roll is called the <b>Armor Class (AC).</b></dd>
        </dl>
      </p>
    <h2><a class="ruleslink" id="adv-and-dis">Advantage & Disadvantage</a></h2>
      <p class="info">
        Sometimes a roll is affected by positive or negative circumstances notable enough to push the result in a specific direction. These are called advantage and disadvantage, and function similarly to one another. A character who has advantage on a D20 roll will roll two times and take the higher total of the two rolls. A character with disadvantage will do the opposite, rolling twice and taking the lower of the two rolls. Advantage and disadvantage both only apply to D20 rolls.
      </p>
    <h2><a class="ruleslink" id="specific-beats">Specific Beats General</a></h2>
      <p class="info">
        There are a great deal of rules in this document that govern how this game plays. However, there are many abilities given to specific folk, classes, or through feats that break how the rules of the game work in one way or another. In these cases, where one rule contradicts another, the specific rule (granted by the folk/class/feat/spell/etc) always supersedes the general rule.<br><br>
        For example, when a player‚Äôs hit points drops to ‚Äú0‚Äù they are either knocked unconscious, or they begin dying. However, Humans have a trait that allows them to regain one hit point the moment they are reduced to 0HP, for the sake of staying up and continuing to fight. This specific rule overrides the more general rule.
      </p>
    <h2><a class="ruleslink" id="round-down">Round Down</a></h2>
      <p class="info">
        The final basic rule to keep in mind is that whenever you end up with a fraction of a number, always round down, even if the fraction is one half or greater. The only time you wouldn‚Äôt round down is in instances of a specific rule telling you to round up.

    <p class="flavor">
      The first thing you‚Äôll have to do when beginning a game of GODHAND is build a character. Sometimes building the character is as much fun as playing them! Gathering up the idea for how they will play, how they look, their story, and putting that all together can be a fun game in itself.<br><br>
      A short explanation if this is your first time playing a TTRPG; your character is your avatar in the game. You act through them, but they aren‚Äôt necessarily you. Your character is a creation of yours that you
      give their own story, with their personality quirks, traits and motivations that make them feel like their own unique individual.
    </p>
    <h2><a class="ruleslink" id="conceptualization">Conceptualization</a></h2>
    <p class="info">
      Before diving into the bones of what makes a character, in the mechanical sense, you should consider what sort of character you‚Äôd like to play. Their appearance (are they human? human like? just a totally unique entity?) How do they fight? Do they fight at all? What‚Äôs their personality like, and what significant events could you use to define their past? You might want to build a character based on your interests; someone into classic high fantasy for example, might enjoy playing an elf wizard who manipulates reality through their knowledge of the esoteric and arcane.<br><br>
      Something also worth considering very seriously when building a character is the nature of the game you‚Äôre going to be thrust into. A heavily armored warrior with no magical capabilities and a burning hatred for his fellow man - fighting constant violent impulses and the traumas of his past - might struggle in a more lighthearted game where all the other players are students enrolled in a magic academy. A priestly pacifist who is so devout in their beliefs that they won‚Äôt even protect or heal those that commit acts of violence might be frustrating to players in a tactical game about soldiers fighting in a war.<br><br>
      This isn‚Äôt to say that you shouldn‚Äôt make character concepts that are a little out there, or even ones that go against the grain of the game, but when building a character it helps to keep two things in mind:<br><br>
      <b>1. </b>You, the GM, and your fellow players (if there are any) will both have more fun if you ensure your character is relevant or tied to the game‚Äôs setting and the story the GM and other players want to tell.<br><br>
      <b>2. </b> If you are playing alongside other players, you should make a character who works well with others. It‚Äôs fine to make a grouchy character who doesn‚Äôt enjoy the company of others, for example, but a character should be able to function as a part of the group without being frustrating to work with. <br><br>
      The two concepts previously mentioned could both work perfectly fine in their specific games, with a degree of effort on the part of the GM and player. The battle-scarred warrior could be the bodyguard of another player character (a wealthy noble, perhaps) or even a supplemental professor at the magic academy, teaching a mundane skill. A person, who despite being very cold to the world, has a soft spot for the other player characters, and wants to do whatever he can to see them succeed in their goals. A character like this can progress the story in ways that might have been very difficult for the previous iteration of the concept. The pacifist is an even simpler fix; a chaplain in a small mercenary band who develops the abilities of a prophet through their faith, using those powers to heal their friends when they injure themselves in battle so that even if they aren‚Äôt contributing to the violence themselves, their presence is still a benefit to their allies and they still fill an important role on the team.<br><br>
      In short, when making a character you should do your best to work with your team and your GM to come up with a concept that will be both fun to play and fun to play alongside.

    <h2><a class="ruleslink">Building Your Character</a></h2>
      <p class="info">
        When you have everything in mind about your character and about how you‚Äôd like them to be, make use of this section to build them accurately to your vision. The character might change a little with each choice you make building them, and that‚Äôs okay! The most important part of building a character is that you come to the game with someone you‚Äôre excited to play.

      <p class="info">
        One of the biggest choices in building your character is determining what sort of folks they are. In a world where Human warriors, fae mages, and serpentine thieves exist together, your appearance and natural abilities have some bearing on how others will perceive you, which is an interestingrel ationship to play with.<br><br>
        The sort of folk you choose for your character has no inherent bearing on your abilities, though based on what you choose you will gain a set of unique traits based on which folk you choose. Halflings are lucky and brave, Catfolk are quick and (shockingly) catlike, Orcs are big and  strong. It‚Äôs up to you if you want these characteristics to be at all relevant to your character, if you want to play into them, or play someone who has little use for them. An Elf Wizard is a classic, but an Elf Fighter is an interesting divergence, and could make for a memorable character!

    <h2><a class="ruleslink" id="choose-class"><a href="classes.html"style="font-family:papyrus;">2. Choosing your Class</a></a></h2>
      <p class="info">
        Each character in GODHAND has a class. This class determines most of their abilities, especially the ones they‚Äôll use in combat. A player who wants to be a skilled warrior or a chivalrous knight might play a Fighter. A player intending to explore the mysteries of reality and blow up enemies with their mind would likely want to play a Wizard. A player should consider what it is they‚Äôll enjoy doing most when playing the game, be it fighting monsters, casting magic, or simply getting by on quick wit and a sharp tongue.<br><br>
        You gain a number of benefits from your class, referred to as ‚Äúclass features.‚Äù These class features are what set your character apart from the common people of their world, and from members of other classes. Your character also gains a number of proficiencies from their class. To talk about proficiency though, we need to delve into:
      </p>
    <h2><a class="ruleslink" id="proficiency-and-prog">Proficiency & Character Progression</a></h2>
      <table style="border:0;">
        <tr>
          <td style="text-align:left; border:0;"> <!--all the text info-->
            <p class="info">
              When a roll mentions ‚Äúrelevant bonuses,‚Äù there are two bonuses which are almost always relevant. These are a character‚Äôs bonus in the stat used for the roll, called their "ability modifier" (such as Strength for swinging a greatsword, or Charisma for attempting to lie to someone), and their ‚Äúproficiency bonus,‚Äù which represents a character‚Äôs training or capability in what it is they‚Äôre doing.<br><br>
              What proficiencies a character has is determined by a multitude of factors including their background, feats, class, and even some folk and bloodline abilities. It‚Äôs important to keep track of all of them by marking them on your character sheet! Without doing so, you might be forgetting something your character is very good at. The proficiency bonus itself is determined by character level.<br><br>
              The table on the right  displays the number you add for your proficiency bonus at each level, starting with +2 at level 1, and increasing by 1 at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. The details on this table are universal, and apply regardless of a character‚Äôs class or combination of classes; a level 1 character will always have a +2 proficiency bonus, a level 5 character will always have a +3, and so forth.<br><br>
              The character progression table also mentions experience points (XP), Feats, and Ability Score Improvements (ASIs). A number of XP is assigned to each level, meaning that when a character‚Äôs total accrued experience points equals or surpasses one of the numbers listed on the table, their level increases correspondingly. Characters gain XP from killing monsters, completing quests, collecting treasure, learning skills, and other methods.<br><br>
              As opposed to using experience points, your GM may choose to level characters up at specific milestones within a story, forgoing XP entirely. Both of these are perfectly legitimate ways to play, and both ultimately come down to the GM and their preference.<br><br>
              Additionally, other aspects of your character affect your proficiencies and your progression:<br><br>
              <b>Ability score improvements (ASI)</b> are levels within a character‚Äôs class where a character gains two points they can assign to their ability scores. These points can both be assigned to a single ability score, or they may be distributed to different ability scores as the player sees fit.<br><br>
              <b>Feats</b> are extra abilities and bonuses a character gains through progression. <b><u>A character always gains one feat at first level, unless they take a bloodline when choosing their Folk.</u></b> All feats in Godhand are listed <a href="feats.html"><u>here</u></a>.

        Record your character‚Äôs level and proficiency bonus on your character sheet when starting the game. If you begin at a higher level than 1, record all other class features you gain in addition to the ones at first level, and account for any feats, ability score increases (ASIs), or increases in proficiency bonus you would gain from starting at that level.

    <h2><a class="ruleslink" id="hit-die-and-hp">Hit Dice & Hit Points</a></h2>
      <p class="info">
        In addition to the character progression details and class features, when considering your character‚Äôs class you should also be aware of hit dice (HD) and hit points (HP). Hit points define how well a character handles injuries without being incapacitated or lethally wounded. Your total hit points are determined by your hit dice and your Constitution score.<br><br>
        At 1st level, you have one hit die, determined by your class. When you gain a level, you gain an additional hit die. Should you take levels in a class different from the one you begin in, you gain that class‚Äô hit die as opposed to the one given by your starting class (for example, a Fighter who takes a level in the Wizard class gains a d6 hit die for that level as opposed to a d10).<br><br>
        To calculate your hit points at first level, take the maximum number on your hit die, and then add your Constitution modifier. This is your maximum HP. To calculate at the following levels, you may either roll your hit dice every time you level up and add the total to your max HP, or you may take the average on the dice rounded up (4 for a d6, 5 for a d8, 6 for a d10, and 7 for a d12) and add that number to your max HP. Regardless of the option you choose, you add your Constitution modifier each time you increase your maximum HP in this manner.

          As a 1st level Fighter, Malen has a d10 hit die and starts with hit points equal to 10 + her Constitution modifier. Hazel notes this and records the final number after she figures out Malen‚Äôs Constitution score (step 3). She also notes that the proficiency bonus for a level 1 character is +2. She does not choose a feat, as she had decided to make Malen a Nephilim in step 1.

          <b>Building Malen, Step 4:</b> Hazel determines that Malen is a Human woman with light brown skin and long, meticulously kept hair. Her eyes are a warm shade of yellow and she dresses herself like one who is always traveling; in light, comfortable clothes that do little to restrict her range of motion and which don‚Äôt weigh her down when she makes long stretches on the road. She is toned, but thin, and she stands just a few inches under six feet. When she uses her abilities as a Nephilim to transform, her visage becomes terrible and confusing, a winged monster ringed by white hot flame, sculpted from marble and held together by gold, without any face to look upon.

    <h2><a class="ruleslink" id="weapon-prop">Weapon Properties</a></h2>
      <p class="info">
        Weapons will have different properties which affect the ways in which they can be used. Below is an explanation of each:
      </p>
        <details class="sub-list"><summary><b>List of Weapon Properties</b></summary>
          <br>
          <h3><a id="weap-abi" class="ruleslink"><b>Ability: </b></a></h3>
            <p class="info">This determines which ability score modifier you add when making attack rolls and calculating damage with a particular weapon. Usually, this is Strength or Dexterity. Some weapons may be used with either Strength or Dexterity, and some weapons may require a minimum Strength or Dexterity score to be used effectively.</p>
          <h3><a id="ammunition" class="ruleslink"><b>Ammunition: </b></a></h3>
            <p class="info">A weapon with the mmunition property requires separate ammunition in order to be used. Each time this weapon is used, a piece of that ammunition is expended.</p>
          <h3><a id="weap-class-prof" class="ruleslink"><b>Class Proficiency: </b></a></h3>
            <p class="info">Class proficiency determines which classes have proficiency with these weapons by default.</p>
          <h3><a id="concealable" class="ruleslink"><b>Concealable: </b></a></h3>
            <p class="info">A weapon which is concealable can be hidden from sight under a set of everyday clothes without any specialized means. They may still be discovered if a person is searched, or noticed if a creature makes an investigation check to spot hidden weapons. You may contest this check with a sleight of hand check of your own. If you succeed in the contest, the weapon or weapons you are carrying stay hidden.</p>
          <h3><a id="heavy" class="ruleslink"><b>Heavy: </b></a></h3>
            <p class="info">A heavy weapon cannot be wielded effectively by a creature which is sized Small or smaller</p>
          <h3><a id="improvised" class="ruleslink"><b>Improvised: </b></a></h3>
            <p class="info">In place of a proper weapon, an improvised equivalent may be produced with scrap or scavenged from the surroundings if a suitable equivalent is available (for example, a broken chair leg may be used as a blackjack, or a sharpened stick may be used as a spear)<br>
            Improvised weapons are not as sturdy as purpose-made ones. Upon rolling a natural 1 on the attack roll, or if the attack roll totals 1 or less, the weapon breaks and may no longer be used.</p>
          <h3><a id="light" class="ruleslink"><b>Light: </b></a></h3>
            <p class="info">A light weapon may be wielded in one‚Äôs off-hand for the purposes of dual wielding.</p>
          <h3><a id="one-hand-two-hand" class="ruleslink"><b>One-handed & Two-handed: </b></a></h3>
            <p class="info">A one-handed weapon may be effectively wielded in only one hand, while a two-handed weapon requires both hands on the weapon in order to wield (though they may still be carried in one hand). Some weapons can be used both ways, gaining a small bonus to potential damage when they are wielded with both hands.</p>
          <h3><a id="ranged" class="ruleslink"><b>Ranged: </b></a></h3>
            <p class="info">A ranged weapon is able to attack from a distance. All ranged weapons have a given range in which they may be used, listed in feet and split into 3 increments; close range, mid range, and long range. A character or creature makes ranged weapon attacks within the weapon‚Äôs close range increment with no penalties, within its mid range with a -2 penalty to its attack rolls, and within its long range with disadvantage on its attack rolls. A ranged weapon cannot be used effectively past its long range, even if the projectile may travel farther.</p>
          <h3><a id="reach" class="ruleslink"><b>Reach: </b></a></h3>
            <p class="info">A melee weapon‚Äôs reach determines how far away it can hit from. A weapon with a reach of 5ft may hit a target 5ft away, a weapon with a reach of 10ft may hit a target 10ft away, and so forth.</p>
          <h3><a id="reload" class="ruleslink"><b>Reload: </b></a></h3>
            <p class="info">A weapon with the reload property must be manually loaded after making a particular number of attacks, listed as a number next to the property. You may not fire the weapon more than this many times per round.</p>
          <h3><a id="throwable" class="ruleslink"><b>Throwable: </b></a></h3>
            <p class="info">A throwable weapon is a ranged weapon which is physically thrown by the wielder. All thrown weapons have a range of 15/30/45. The weapon is lost after it is thrown until it is picked up again.</p>
          <br><hr><br>
          <h3><a id="special" class="ruleslink"><b>Special: </b></a></h3>
            <p class="info">A weapon may have properties unique to that weapon. Consult the weapon on the weapon table to see if a particular weapon has any special properties and what they are.</p>
          <h3><a id="weap-expert" class="ruleslink"><b>Weapon Expertise: </b></a></h3>
            <p class="info">Weapons are more nuanced than simply being tools for cutting and bashing. A true expert with a particular weapon can use such quirks to their advantage in a fight. When you gain expertise in a weapon, you gain access to additional benefits when wielding that weapon. Note that you do not double your proficiency bonus when making attack rolls, as you would with expertise in your skills.</p>

    <!--Armor Properties-->
    <h2><a class="ruleslink" id="armor-prop"><b>Armor Properties</b></a></h2>

        <h3><a id="armor-layer" class="ruleslink"><b>Armor Layering</b></a></h3>
          <p class="info">
            Armor in GODHAND has three layers, an inner layer, a middle layer, and an outer layer, meaning a character can wear up to three pieces of armor. When layering armor in such a way, combine their joint AC bonus, their weight, and all of their traits (though if two traits cancel each other out, simply omit them).<br><br>
            A piece of armor cannot occupy the same layer as another piece of armor (for example, one cannot have two pieces of armor on the inner layer) and cannot wear more than three pieces of armor at once. Additionally, all armor can be worn over light armor, light armor cannot be worn over medium or heavy armor, and medium armor armor cannot be worn over heavy armor, and heavy armor cannot be worn over heavy armor.<br><br>
            For each additional layer of armor, take the lowest maximum Dexterity Bonus of the worn armor, and reduce it by 1. With regard to armor layering, the following properties influence which pieces of armor can and can‚Äôt be layered with one another.

  <!--Skills and Abilities Rules-->
  <details class="rules"><summary><h1><div class="tooltip">Skills & Abilities<span class="tooltiptext">Click to Expand/Collapse</span></div></h1></summary>
    <p class="flavor">
      A character‚Äôs ability scores are a primary determining factor for how they might interact with the world. These are so crucial that they‚Äôve been given a few explanations previous to this, but for context, the six ability scores function as follows:<br><br>
      <b>Strength</b> measures a character‚Äôs basic physical capabilities, gross motor skill, and raw might.<br><br>
      <b>Dexterity</b> measures a character‚Äôs agility, fine motor skill, and reaciton time.<br><br>
      <b>Constitution</b> measures a character‚Äôs durability and internal fortitude.<br><br>
      <b>Intelligence</b> measures a character‚Äôs general knowledge both practical and less practical, as well as the speed at which they pick up new ideas.<br><br>
      <b>Wisdom</b> measures a character‚Äôs awareness of the world and others around them, their insights into things greater than themself, and their mental fortitude.<br><br>
      <b>Charisma</b> measures the force of a character‚Äôs personality, and how effectively they use it. It is not inherently ‚Äúlikeability.‚Äù
    </p>
    <h2><a class="ruleslink" id="ability-mods">Ability Modifiers</a></h2>
    <p class="info">
      Ability scores can be as low as <b>1</b> for particularly pathetic creatures, or higher than <b>30</b> for divine entities. That said, for most Sublunarian creatures, the average in any ability score is between 8 and <b>12</b>, with <b>8</b> being below considerably average, <b>12</b> being considerably above average, and <b>10</b> being the perfect middle. Each ability score has a correlating bonus that a character adds to any rolls of the dice they make utilizing that ability. A character does not add their ability score, but does add this correlating bonus. Ability bonuses start at 0, at ability score <b>10</b>, and increase by 1 for every 2 points higher a score is than 10 (and the inverse is true, as they decrease by 1 for every 2 points below 10. A character can have a negative ability bonus, but cannot have a negative ability score).
    </p>
    <h2><a class="ruleslink" id="proficiency-bonus">Proficiency Bonus</a></h2>
    <p class="info">
      All characters have a proficiency bonus that correlates with their level, as detailed in the first chapter. Monsters also have a proficiency bonus, which is included in their stat blocks. This bonus is used on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with which a creature has proficiency.<br><br>
      A creature cannot add their proficiency bonus to a single die roll more than once. If two different rules say you add your proficiency bonus to an attack roll, you would still only add your proficiency bonus once.<br><br>
      This being said, some rules might multiply or divide a character‚Äôs proficiency bonus (like the expertise feature), though even if some circumstance suggests you add your proficiency bonus twice to a roll, you would still only add it once, as well as only multiplying or dividing it once, based on the features in play.
    </p>
    <h2><a class="ruleslink" id="ability-mods">Ability Modifiers</a></h2>
    <table style="border:0;">
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align:left; border:0;">
          <p class="info">
            Often, a character will attempt to undertake challenges that require the use of their ability scores or their more refined skills. When this occurs, the GM will most likely ask a character to make an ability check, which involves a roll of the d20, adding the relevant ability score or skill bonus to the total.<br><br>
            The GM will prompt players to roll ability checks when a scenario relevant to them arises, choosing the most applicable ability or skill to address the task the character has set about doing. Players do not roll ability checks without prompting from the GM, unless dictated otherwise by a rule, or a ruling by their GM. This is to limit confusing scenarios in which players might make a roll, and argue with their GM as to what the result might be, when the roll may not have been relevant in the first place.Each ability check has a difficulty class (here on referred to as a DC) which dictates how difficult a certain activity might be. A DC is the number a player needs to meet or beat when making an ability check. A general guideline for setting DCs is provided on the right.<br><br>
            ‚ÄúIncredibly Easy‚Äù is marked on the table with an asterix for the sake of noting that if a task is very easy, a GM generally shouldn‚Äôt call for a roll. Only if a character can fail an ability check, and if this failure will have significant consequences on the narrative (or simply on the scene being played out) should a GM call for a roll of the dice. Calling for a roll to woo a barmaid or catch a friend falling to their doom are both examples of good uses for an ability check. Calling for a roll to walk across a normal room, or to open an unlocked door are less worthwhile uses of an ability check.

    <h2><a class="ruleslink" id="contests">Contests</a></h2>
    <p class="info">
      There are times when a character might be acting in direct opposition to a monster. A character attempting to escape a grapple, for example, or two characters trying to arm-wrestle one another. Essentially, both are doing the same thing (or attempting to accomplish a similar goal) and only one can succeed. Such situations call for a contest.<br><br>
      In a contest (sometimes referred to as a ‚Äúcontested roll‚Äù) two or more characters make an ability check, applying their modifiers as appropriate, however instead of rolling against a set DC, the rolls are measured against each other, with the highest total winning the contest.<br><br>
      In the event of a contest winning in a tie, the situation that sparked the contest remains unchanged. For example, if a monster attempts to drag a character underwater, and the contest ends in a tie, the character would remain above the water. Often, a tie means the contest will be repeated, as with the aforementioned monster scenario, the monster will likely attempt to drown the character again on its next turn, unless the character breaks free from its grasp and escapes.

    <h2><a class="ruleslink" id="skills">Skills</a></h2>
    <p class="info">
      Skills in GODHAND represent a character interacting with the world around them in various ways. Not every action requires a skill check, and the general rule of thumb is that a skill check should only be made if there is more than a miniscule chance of failure. The uses listed for these skills are not comprehensive, and they can be used in other creative ways based on their descriptions and purposes. Skills are also meant to interact with one another; for example, a Perception check may reveal several clues or objects of note, and a subsequent Investigation check could piece together that these clues all point to a trap, or a secret door. An Investigation check revealing information about a settlement‚Äôs culture may help with a Perform check later, by offering important context for how to best play to the area‚Äôs audience.

          This skill determines your ability to arrest a crowd with a show. It may be a show of strength, or acrobatics, or music, or comedy. This also encompasses your ability to mimic others.<br><br>
          <b><u>Uses</u></b><br>
          <b>Bolster Voice:</b> When you are attempting to trick, convince, or coerce someone into something using another Charisma-based skill, you may take some action and make a Performance check to lend credence to your words. If the audience hates you, the DC for this check is 25. If they dislike you, the DC for this check is 20. If they are ambivalent, the DC for this check is 10. If they like you, the DC for this check is 5. If you succeed, you gain advantage on your next Charisma check. If you fail, you make the check as normal. If you fail by 5 or more, you suffer disadvantage on your next Charisma check.<br><br>
          <b>Perform:</b> Once per long rest while you are in a settlement, you may perform for an audience. The DC of the performance depends on the venue and audience; a street performance would have a DC of 5; a performance in a tavern would have a DC of 10; a scheduled performance before a local audience in a small theater would have a DC of 15; a performance before important officials or figures of authority would have a DC of 20; a performance before a huge audience in a grand theater would have a DC of 25. When you begin your performance, you may make a Perform check. Any spells or abilities you use to enhance the check must have an effect that lasts for the duration of the performance.<br><br>
          If you succeed by 5 or more, your performance earns you an appropriate amount of recognition and you are noticed by a figure of authority or importance appropriate for that venue; you also earn gold equal to twice your Perform check, in addition to twice the amount of any agreed-upon gold paid for the performance. If you succeed, your performance earns you an appropriate amount of recognition for your venue. In addition, you earn gold equal to your Perform check, in addition to any agreed-upon amount of gold paid for the performance. If you fail, your performance does not accomplish anything notable, and you earn half of any agreed-upon gold paid for the performance. If you fail by 5 or more, your performance fails, your reputation is tarnished, and you do not earn any gold from the performance.

          <b><u>Uses</u></b><br>
          <b>Sway:</b> You may make a Persuasion check contested by a creature‚Äôs Insight check to sway them to your point of view.

If you fail, they are not convinced to adopt your point of view. If you fail by 5 or more, they become convinced that you are delusional for possessing your point of view. If you or your allies have harmed the creature within the past day, this check is made with disadvantage.<br><br>
          <b>Catch Gossip:</b> When you make a check to gather information in an area through methods that involve speaking with others, you may make a Persuasion check with a DC equal to the check you made. If you succeed, you are able to reroll that check once to see if you get a better result. You may use the highest roll. This may only be done once per attempt to gather information.

          <b>Identifying Celestial or Fiend:</b> When you encounter a creature that may be celestial or fiendish, you may make a Religion check with a DC equal to the creature‚Äôs CR. If you succeed by 5 or more, you identify the creature and learn what attacks it can make, as well as any vulnerabilities or resistances. If you succeed, you identify the creature and may choose to learn of either one of its attacks, its resistances, or vulnerabilities. If you fail, you do not learn anything about the creature. If you fail by 5 or more, you may learn false information about the creature. If the creature is not a celestial, devil, or demon, you are able to recognize so on a roll higher than 10.

          <b><u>Uses</u></b><br>
          <b>Sign Language:</b> : You may slip a secret message into innocuous conversation through hand signals by making a Sleight of Hand check. The DC is 15 for simple messages, and 20 for complex messages. If you are proficient in Cant, you make this check with advantage if conveying a message to someone who is not proficient in Cant.

          <b>Palm:</b> You may attempt to swipe a small object and stow it away by making a Sleight of Hand check with a DC equal to the passive perception of any creature that is capable of noticing you. If you succeed by 5 or more, the creature is convinced you couldn‚Äôt have done anything. If you succeed, the creature does not notice you. If you fail, the creature becomes suspicious of your movement, and may act appropriately. If you fail by 5 or more, you are fully noticed by the creature, and they may act appropriately.<br><br>
          If someone has already seen you attempt to take something, their passive perception gains a +5 bonus against your Sleight of Hand attempt.

In combat, this check is usually an Action. If you succeed by 5 or more, the creature is convinced that you are gone. If you succeed, the creature does not notice you. If you fail, the creature notices signs of your presence, grows suspicious, and may act accordingly. If you fail by 5 or more, the creature immediately knows where you are, and acts accordingly; if it attacks, the attack has advantage. You may only hide if there is cover, such as a crowd, an underbrush, or a hole.<br><br>
          If someone has already seen you hide, their Passive Perception gains a +5 bonus against your Stealth attempt.

          <b>Forage:</b> During a short rest, you may attempt to forage for food and water with a Survival check. If you roll a 5 or above, you are able to find a meal‚Äôs worth of food and water for yourself.

          Food and water cannot be created, and this ability may only yield food or water as appropriate for the area; a desert may have no water, while a frozen dead forest may have no life.<br><br>
          <b>Navigate:</b> When you travel, you may make a Survival check and move more slowly to avoid trouble on the road. The DC is equal to 10 + the number of vehicles and people, excluding yourself, you are traveling with. If you move at your normal pace, the DC of the check increases by 5.
