    <h1>The Enlightened (STILL WIP)</h1>
    <p class="flavor"><i>
      Wizard who seeks omnipotence. Playing god’s most dangerous game out here.
    </i>
  </p>
  <h2>2nd-Level - Precognition</h2>
    <p class="info">
      At 2nd level, you are able to make very brief glimpses into the future of potentially crucial moments in time. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these precognitive rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.<br><br>
      Each precognitive roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.
    </p>
  <h2>2nd-Level - Adaptable Knowledge</h2>
    <p class="info">
      Additionally at 2nd level, you may replace the ability score used for any ability check with your intelligence score. You choose to do this before you roll the ability check. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your intelligence modifier, regaining all uses of it on a long rest.
    </p>
  <h2>6th-Level - Read Like a Book</h2>
    <p class="info">
      At 6th level, you may choose any individual creature, and attempt to peer into the depths of their soul to know as much as possible about them as you can as an action. When you use this ability, a creature must make a charisma save against your spell save DC. On a failed save you learn:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The general gist of the creature’s upbringing.</li><br>
      <li>Any facts about the creature that make them unique, or noteworthy deeds they’ve committed.</li><br>
      <li>Anyone significant the creature is familiar with, either significant to them, to you, or to your allies, and the nature of their relationship with them.</li><br>
      <li>Any notable opinions the creature has, be them personal, political, pertaining to you or your allies, or otherwise.</li><br>
      <li>Every single thought the creature has had over the course of the last month.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="info">
      The GM does not (and likely cannot) provide all of this at once, but answers any questions you might have pertaining to this creature, and any facts about them that fall into one of these categories, as you will know them naturally. Anything beyond what the GM provides, you must ask for. You do not necessarily know everything about the creature you read, but likely gain a very, very good idea of who they are.<br><br>
      A creature you use this ability on is not aware they’ve been read in any way, regardless of if they pass or fail the save. You take 1d6 psychic damage upon using this successfully, as the massive influx of information wracks your mind. After using this ability, you must complete a long rest before using it again.
    </p>
  <h2>10th-Level - Sight Beyond Sight</h2>
    <p class="info">
      At 10th level, you gain blindsight and truesight out to a range of 60 feet. Creatures within this range do not benefit from invisibility against you, and cannot hide from you. You can no longer be surprised.
    </p>
  <h2>10th-Level - Instantaneous Understanding</h2>
    <p class="info">
      Additionally at 10th level, you learn the legend lore spell (if you didn’t know it already), and are able to cast it as an action, without any material component.
    </p>
  <h2>14th-Level - Pull the Curtain</h2>
    <p class="info">
      At 14th level, you gain the ability to place your palm on a creature, and for a moment you share your power with them, revealing their future down to the moment they die. This future is not necessarily set in stone, but still shocks the creature to their core. The creature takes 10d6 psychic damage and must make a wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, on a failed save, if the creature had been hostile beforehand, they instantly cease hostilities, leave combat, and go home to think about their life.
    </p>
  <h2>20th-Level - All Knowing</h2>
    <p class="info">
      At 20th level, you understand reality for what it truly is, you are aware of all that has ever been, all that is now, and many things that may potentially come to pass. You gain the following benefits from your immense knowledge:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Treat all creatures you encounter as being under the effects of your ‘read like a book’ feature. Treat all objects and places you encounter as if they were under the effects of a legend lore spell.
      </li>
      <li>
        You are considered to be perpetually under the effects of a Foresight spell.
      </li>
      <li>
        You instantly succeed on any skill check that uses your intelligence score.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="info">
      Additionally, any questions you ask about the world your character inhabits, your GM must answer honestly. Your DM cannot however tell you what questions to ask. For example, someone might tell your character about a restaurant in another city. Using this ability you could ask about who owns this restaurant, you could ask about their personality, about the secrets they keep, the people they love, what they are thinking about right now in this present moment, and so on. However, if you do not know about the restaurant in the first place, you cannot ask these questions.<br><br>
      This is because, while you might have overwhelming knowledge, you are still very mortal, and need to actively sift through it yourself. If you do not know where to begin, you will struggle to begin at all.
