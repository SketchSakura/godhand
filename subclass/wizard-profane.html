    <h1>The Profane</h1>
    <p class="flavor"><i>
      Those who commit to the study of the forbidden, the darkest paths and parts of their realities, and pry into the most hidden secrets of the universe for the sake of incredible power no matter the cost, are the profane.
    </i>
  </p>
  <h2>2nd-Level - Dread Tongues</h2>
    <p class="info">
      At 2nd level, you are always able to converse with Aberrations, Celestials, Demons, and Devils, regardless of the languages you or them know. You have advantage on any Charisma checks you make to interact with them, but disadvantage on Wisdom saves made against their spells and effects.
    </p>
  <h2>2nd-Level - Claim Vitality</h2>
    <p class="info">
      Also at 2nd level you may use a Reaction to rip the living essence from the bodies of your fallen enemies and convert it to power. Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you may use a Reaction to regain an expended spell slot. You may use this ability a number of times equal to half your Intelligence modifier (rounded up, minimum of 1), regaining all uses of it on a long rest.
    </p>
  <h2>6th-Level - Horrific Truths</h2>
    <p class="info">
      Starting at 6th level, you may reveal a sliver of terrible knowledge to your enemies. Choose a number of creatures within 60 feet of you equal to your Intelligence modifier. Those creatures must attempt Intelligence saving throws against your spell save DC. On a failed save, each creature is either reduced to babbling insanity and is <a href="../rules/combat.html#incapacitated"><u>Incapacitated</u></a> or <a href="../rules/combat.html#frightened"><u>Frightened</u></a> of you (your choice) for a minute. A creature may attempt this saving throw again on the end of their turn. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest, or expend a spell slot of 3rd circle or higher to use it again.
    </p>
  <h2>10th-Level - Warp</h2>
    <p class="info">
      Starting at 10th level, you gain access to a realm of terror bound to myriad realities, and may use its strange connections to your own point in reality to manipulate your own presence in space, and the presence of others. You may use this ability in three ways:
      <ul>
        <li>
          As a Bonus Action on your turn, you may teleport to any space you can see within 60 feet of you. For every 10 feet you travel with this ability, you take 1d6 psychic damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          As an Action on your turn, you may force a creature you can see to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (a creature can choose to fail this save). On a failed save, you teleport the creature to any space within 60 feet of you that you can see. The creature takes 1d6 psychic damage for every 10 feet they travel with this ability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Over the course of an hour, you may map out a complex route across this dimension in your mind, to any space within one mile of you that you have personally been. At the end of this hour, you and any number of willing allies within 10 feet of you appear in the place you have chosen, each of you taking 10d6 psychic damage from the weight of the journey.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  <h2>14th-Level - Bearer of Curses</h2>
    <p class="info">
      At 14th level, you may choose to ignore the curses placed upon any magic items, using them as if they had no curse at all. However, you may instead choose to risk shouldering the burden of the curse yourself for the sake of harming others. As an Action, you force a creature you can see to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, that creature is treated as having the negative effects of the item‚Äôs curse. Should the creature succeed on the save however, you yourself are instead treated as being cursed by the object.
    </p>
  <h2>20th-Level - Hell on Earth</h2>
    <p class="info">
      At 20th level, you are able to rip regions of the world asunder with your power. Using all the dark knowledge provided to you, you may begin a ritual that lasts one day. At the end of the day, a region with a radius of 10 miles around the place the ritual was completed is wracked with the following horrors for one week:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The sky is dark as the darkest night and totally starless. Without a source of light or darkvision, it is impossible to navigate.
      </li><br>
      <li>
        A sea of Aberrations, Celestials, Demons, or Devils (you choose when performing this ritual) appear from the aether and swarm the area, to begin killing, capturing, torturing, and tormenting indiscriminately. These creatures are not under your control, but they are not hostile to you, or anyone you designate as being friendly to you by marking them with a symbol associated with you.
      </li><br>
      <li>
        Natural disasters rip the land apart. At the end of the week, any buildings in the region will be reduced to rubble, save for any you designate as being ‚Äúsafe‚Äù with the same symbol you use to ward creatures.
      </li><br>
      <li>
        Anyone except those marked by you, is unable to teleport out of this region by any means.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="info">
      These effects end if you are killed at any point in time, but they do not end instantly, lingering for an hour before truly dissipating. If this region is tormented for the entirety of a week, the land will be cursed. Nothing will grow there again, infants born within its bounds will emerge as Cambions or Nephilim, rain will scald the skin of inhabitants, and illness will often befall those who choose to live here.<br><br>
      Any creatures not marked by you that do not manage to escape this region will be found dead at the end of the week.
